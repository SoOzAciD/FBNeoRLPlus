What is FB Alpha Retro Loader ?
----------------------------------------------------

FB Alpha RL is a PS3 homebrew application coded from scratch,
and not based in any other public source code by other 
developers. It is a result of many hours of dedication
and research.

It is in no way a dirty hack of RetroArch or something 
similar. By the contrary, FB Alpha RL serves as a independent 
frontend to RetroArch and provides features not incorporated 
in it.

I did had to make a modified RetroArch core to be included
along my application, so it could process the arguments
or new commands that FB Alpha RL will be sending to it.

Objective of FB Alpha RL (Retro Loader):
----------------------------------------------------

As a dev from the official FB Alpha Team, 
FB Alpha RL was made with a objective in mind, to
keep the original experience from the official
FB Alpha (for Windows OS) on the PS3 system.

Please, read the technical info for more details.

Technical Info:
----------------------------------------------------

Signed for CFW 3.40 / 3.55 / 4.XX (should work for everyone).

Tested @ 1080p / 720p / 480p resolutions via HDMI.

FB Alpha RL uses a custom "burn_drivers.h" header file
that was generated by modifying the official windows
version of FB Alpha with a routine to generate such
file on launch.

The header have a big structure with all the information
for all supported drivers in FB Alpha v0.2.97.28.
Information such as: 

- Romset Name (Ex. kof2002)
- Parent ROM (Ex. sf2)
- Year
- Manufacturer (Ex. Capcom)
- System (Ex. Neo Geo)
- Max players
- Game Screen Resolution
- Game Screen Aspect Ratio

Future release will have a custom generated header with 
all the ROM information as well, so the application will 
be able to verify every romset with precise CRC32 checks 
(as in the official FB Alpha for Windows).

NOTE: You don't need the official RetroArch installed,
this already has my own modified build incorporated
into FB Alpha RL installation directory. So you can safely
install the official RetroArch and it won't interfere.
